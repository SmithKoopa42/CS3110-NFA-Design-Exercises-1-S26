# CS3110-NFA-Design-Exercises-1-S26

1. The problems that gave me the most trouble were 11 and 24 because I was explicitly trying to minimize them. In 11's case I believe I managed to minimize it
   successfully, but for 24 I decided to just go with the simple solution instead. I didn't necessarily avoid any problems - I chose which ones to do via a
   random number generator. I did not ask questions to the instructor or AI.
2. Problem 24 surprised me with a gold string because I was trying to minimize it rather than sticking with the simple solution. The next state I didn't account
   for was in checking for even or odd 0's, since the loop I made there allowed it to accept any string that began with any number of 0s, so long as it ended with
   a 1 in the case of the number of 0's being even. I can avoid such errors by just sticking with the simple solution rather than trying to get fancy with it.
3. This repo was written by Ewan Scott. I used my existing GitHub account on my normal email rather than creating a new one.
